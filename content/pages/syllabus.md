Course Meetings Times
---------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week; 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week; 1 hour / session

Description
-----------

This course is an introduction to computational biology emphasizing the fundamentals of nucleic acid and protein sequence and structural analysis; it also includes an introduction to the analysis of complex biological systems. Topics covered in the course include principles and methods used for sequence alignment, motif finding, structural modeling, structure prediction and network modeling, as well as currently emerging research areas. This course is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students with strong backgrounds in either molecular biology or computer science, but not necessarily both. The scripting language Python—which is widely used for bioinformatics and computational biology—will be used; foundational material covering basic programming skills will be provided by the teaching assistants. Graduate versions of the course involve an additional project component.

Assignments
-----------

Five written or computer-based problem sets will be assigned. These are designed to promote deeper understanding of the principles and algorithms discussed in class and to provide hands-on experience with bioinformatics tools. The scripting language Python—which is widely used for bioinformatics and computational biology—will be used in the problem sets. More information is in the [Assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments) section.

Exams
-----

There will be two 80–minute exams. The material covered on each exam is non-cumulative; consult the [Calendar]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/calendar) to see which topics were covered on each exam. There is no final exam.

Project
-------

Students in one of the graduate versions of this course will complete a computational biology research project. See the [table]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/syllabus#table) for clarification. The project is designed to give you practice in applying computational methods to contemporary problems in biology. Students design and carry out projects working in a group or by themselves. All students will provide online feedback (peer review) on the presentations. More information is in the [Project]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/project) section.
