| [BLAST](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) | Sequence alignments provide a powerful way to compare novel sequences with previously characterized genes. Both functional and evolutionary information can be inferred from well designed queries and alignments. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) provides a method for rapid searching of nucleotide and protein databases. It is a sequence comparison algorithm optimized for speed used to search sequence databases for optimal local alignments to a query. | Altschul, S. F., W. Gish, et al.
