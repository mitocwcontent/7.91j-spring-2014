Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _7.91J Foundations of Computational and Systems Biology_ as it was taught by Profs. Christopher Burge, David Gifford, and Ernest Fraenkel in Spring 2014.

This course is an advanced undergraduate/graduate survey course in computational biology.

*   It is not a systems biology course, but topics important for analyzing complex systems will be presented.
*   It is not a synthetic biology course, but there is a guest lecture by George Church related to synthetic biology.
*   It is not an algorithms course; expertise in designing and analyzing algorithms is not assumed. The essential ideas behind a variety of algorithms will be discussed, but details of implementation are not addressed. Students will have the opportunity to implement at least one bioinformatics algorithm in the homework.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   To develop an understanding of foundational methods in computational biology
*   To enable students to contextualize and understand the basis of a good portion of the research literature in this growing field
*   An additional goal for graduate students: to gain exposure to research in this field

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

*   Graduate studies in computational biology
*   Careers in biotechnology
